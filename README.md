# Guild Wars 2 Daily Tracker
A Guild Wars 2 daily achievement tracker for those with a busy schedule.

# This project is (temporarily) dead until i find the free time to get back into GW2. 
## I write code full time for work now, and find little time for hobby projects, much less games. :-/

I built this app for the following reasons:

- As a way to give back to the community I love so much.
- As a medium to practice the skills I use every day at work in a medium I can destribute openly and collaboratively.
- As a method of exploring the Guild Wars 2 API.
- To make my life (and others, hopefully) a little more convenient.
- To show off the awesome work that the guys over at the Ionic Framework Team have done.

The app is currently in an early state of development. I will update the readme as things progress. I aim to have a working proof of concept before wintersday.
