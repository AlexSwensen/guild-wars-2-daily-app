# Guild Wars 2 Daily Tracker
A Guild Wars 2 daily achievement tracker for those with a busy schedule.

--
I built this app for the following reasons.

- As a way to give back to the community I love so much.
- As a medium to practice the skills i use every day at work in a medium i can destribute openly.
- As a method of exploring the Guild Wars 2 API.
- To make my life (and others, hopefully) a little more convenient.
- To show off the awesome work that the guys over at the Ionic Framework Team have done.
